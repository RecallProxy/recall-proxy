# RecallProxy

## Universal Context Gateway for LLMs

RecallProxy is an implementation-agnostic context gateway for LLM applications.
The repository includes a Rust workspace that separates shared contracts, runtime
orchestration, and background processing concerns.

The goal is to decouple agent behavior from memory vendor lock-in so teams can
evolve from simple stores to richer graph or episodic systems without rewriting
agent code.

## Crate Responsibilities

- **recall-proxy-core**: Provider-agnostic memory abstractions (`ContextEngine` trait,
  `MemoryRecord`, `MemoryProvider`), shared domain types (`MemoryQuery`, `ContextSnippet`,
  `MemoryType`), and event delivery contracts.
- **recall-proxy-config**: Serde-serializable configuration for memory routes
  and provider wiring (`GatewayConfig`, `MemoryRouteConfig`, `EngineProviderConfig`).
- **recall-proxy-gateway**: `ContextGateway` (per-engine-type orchestration) and
  `ContextMemoryGateway` (unified `ContextEngine` trait orchestration) with ingest
  routing and context assembly.
- **recall-proxy-hindsight-worker**: `HindsightPipeline` with a background
  `tokio::mpsc` queue and a pluggable `HindsightExtractor` trait.

## Architecture Milestones (Initial Implementation)

1. **ContextEngine trait system** (`crates/core/src/`)
   - Async trait for engine providers with typed `write` and `query` operations.
   - Engine-neutral `MemoryType` enum for semantic, structural, and temporal memory.

2. **Async hindsight extraction pipeline** (`crates/hindsight-worker/src/`)
   - Background queue with `tokio::mpsc`.
   - Pluggable `HindsightExtractor` trait for converting raw interactions into
     structural and temporal records without blocking request flow.

3. **Multi-engine orchestration config schema** (`crates/config/src/`)
   - Serde-serializable configuration for memory routes and provider wiring.
   - Enables provider swapping via configuration, not gateway refactors.

4. **Gateway orchestration** (`crates/gateway/src/`)
   - Ingest routing for structural + temporal writes.
   - Read assembly across registered engine providers.
   - Two complementary orchestrators: `ContextGateway` (per-engine-type traits)
     and `ContextMemoryGateway` (unified `ContextEngine` trait).

## Hindsight Pipeline Design

The asynchronous response-path design for transcript capture, background handoff,
worker stages, and replay-safe retries is documented in:

- `docs/architecture/hindsight-flow.md`

## Running the Gateway Server

Start the gateway with:

```bash
cargo run -p recall-proxy-gateway
```

The server binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Override with the `RECALL_PROXY_BIND_ADDRESS` environment variable:

```bash
RECALL_PROXY_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:3000 cargo run -p recall-proxy-gateway
```

Verify the service is running:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
# {"status":"ok","service":"recall-proxy-gateway"}
```

## Docker

You can build and run the gateway server using Docker for local development.

### Build

```bash
docker build -t recall-proxy-gateway .
```

### Run

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 recall-proxy-gateway
```

By default, the container binds to `0.0.0.0:8080`. You can customize this using environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e RECALL_PROXY_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:3000 recall-proxy-gateway
```

## Testing

Main flows are covered with unit tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

- Ingest writes are routed to structural and temporal engines.
- Read assembly combines context from configured engines.
- Hindsight pipeline processes interactions in the background.

## End-to-End Testing

The repository includes a Docker Compose-based E2E testing setup with promptfoo for validating the gateway's HTTP surface.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- promptfoo (`npm install -g promptfoo`)

### Running E2E Tests

Start the local environment:

```bash
cd examples/e2e
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts:
- **gateway**: The RecallProxy gateway service on port 8080
- **mock-hindsight**: A mock hindsight provider on port 8081

Run the promptfoo tests:

```bash
promptfoo eval
```

### Available Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /ingest` - Ingest interaction data

Example ingest request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"interaction_id": "test-001", "content": "Test interaction"}'
```

## Project Status

Active foundation stage: core abstractions, orchestration scaffolding, and
test-backed flows are in place. Next iterations can add concrete provider
adapters and integration tests against simulated endpoints.
